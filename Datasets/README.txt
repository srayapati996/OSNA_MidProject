## Processing 
L2 assigns each voter to a county fips code based on the county name as reported on each state's voter file. 
The RDH aggregated the individual level voter file to the county level using the 5 digit county fips code (2-digit state + 3 digit county) for the fields listed above using SQL and Python.

## Additional Notes 
The fields in this file correspond to those voters registered to vote on the L2 voter file at their residence as of the date above. 
The vote history fields are tied to individual voters, then aggregated up - not tied to geographies as a whole, and as such the aggregated data shows whether or not voters in the geography voted *anywhere* on the election date, not necessarily specifically in that area. 
As such, this information can be used to approximate how the population in the geography voted historically as a distributed group, but cannot be used to track how individuals in that geography voted at the time of previous elections. 
For snapshots from previous voter files, please reference previous voter files hosted by the RDH. 

The RDH cannot certify the accuracy of any of the information contained within this file.

* RDH is providing aggregates of the top 8 parties in the state. 
** For the narrow ethnicity categories, RDH is providing an aggregate of all ethnicities that have more than 1000 individuals state-wide. 
L2 ethnicity categories use modeling techniques to infer an individual's ethnicity.
Please see the attached PDF for  more information about L2's ethnicity fields.
